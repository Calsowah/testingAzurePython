The Programme conducts activities to\ndisseminate international best consulting practices in all countries of\nTAM/BAS operations. In a continuing effort to contribute to the\ndevelopment of a sustainable infrastructure of local business advisory\nservices in the EBRD BAS Programmes countries of operation, and as part\nof the train-the-trainers principle, the TAM/BAS Programmes in the three\ncountries of the South Caucasus are considering improving business\nconsulting performance through tailor-made courses on Core Consultancy\nSkills and Consulting Ethics (CCS&CE) delivered to consultants in these\ncountries.\nThis initiative is a follow-up of an earlier Presentation delivered in\nMay 2010 in the three countries of the South Caucasus. The BAS Program\ninvited Shaktybek Imashov, a Kyrgyz consultant who was instrumental in\nthe conceptualization, promotion, formation and establishment of the\nCentral Asian Institute of Certified Management Consultants (CAI CMC)\ninto a functioning and sustainable association of professional\nconsultants, to the Caucasus region for the purpose of introducing the\nKyrgyz example of the formation of a consultants association, and\noutlining the steps necessary to bring about the consolidation process to\nbusiness consultants in South Caucasus. The presentation was delivered to\nover 100 consultants.  \nThe objective of this training is to deliver CCS&CE courses to\nconsultants.  The training is an essential element in developing local\nconsulting capacity.  The CCS&CE course will meet the requirements of the\nrecognized institutes of business consulting leading to awarding of the\nCertificate in Management Consulting Essentials. \nIt is expected that one of the outcomes of the proposed series of\ntrainings is that one or more of the trained consultants will become\nqualified to conduct further training courses for consultants on a\nsustainable and commercial basis.
