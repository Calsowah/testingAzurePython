A team reporting project is a 10 day project designed to bring\ncross-ethnic groups of journalists together to work on one topic\nextensively during the 10 days. The topic for the project is decided by\nthe entire team together. The topic will certainly be related to\ndiversity topics such as ethnic minorities, religious minorities,\ndisabled people, refugees or IDPs - basically any group that is\ngenerally marginalised by the mainstream media. The journalists produce\nTV pieces together in teams and then all pieces are edited and put into\na 30 minute programme which is made available to any TV station free of\ncharge. A copy will be available to all participants as well. There will\nbe a local language version of each programme produced. This will be\nachieved by proving subtitles or dubbing where necessary.\nThere will be one team that is made up of 8 TV journalists and two\ntrainers. 4 journalists will be from Armenia and 4 from Georgia. \nThere will be one international and one local trainer working throughout\nthe project. The project will be held primarily in Russian. \nBut pieces will be written in your native language and translated into\nthe English for editing. They will then be translated into Armenian and\nGeorgian for the local language production of each programme.\nProject format:\nThe project takes 10 days. It will be primarily based on one country. In\nthis case the base is Yerevan. Journalists will travel throughout the\ncountry or region that the project is taking place in - wherever the\nstory takes them. All travel and accommodation throughout the 10 days\nwill be covered by MDI. MDI will also provide travel to Yerevan where\nneeded to take part in the course. MDI will also provide a per diem of\n$15 for each of the 10 days of the project.
