It has been recognized that the latent\ncapacity existing in the country and in the Diaspora are human capacity\nassets that any country should increasingly rely to enhance its national\ncapacity and knowledge building. These human capacity assets include the\nyouth, the unemployed, the retirees, the retrenched personnel and can be\nsourced from the public service, private sector, civil society, and the\nDiaspora. \nHowever, promoting an enabling environment, (in terms of policy\nframework, legal, cultural etc.) as well as establishing the necessary\nimplementation mechanisms are pre-requisite to address and facilitate\nthe mobilization of the latent human capacity.  \nOne approach that could be utilized to unleash or tap the latent\ncapacity within the country and in Diaspora would be through\nvolunteering and civic participation. It has been long established that\nvolunteerism reinforces capacity development, through enhanced\nparticipation, fostering ownership, improving accountability, promoting\ngovernance, ensuring sustainability. \nThe present project consists in the appreciation of the viability of the\ncreation of a National Volunteer Programme in Armenia, which would allow\nall citizens to participate in the development of their country by using\ntheir knowledge and skills to respond to its needs.  \nOn the basis of latest analysis of Armenias experience of volunteerism,\nthe consultant should support the UNV PO in identifying local possibility\nof civic engagement and opportunities for the involvement of government\nand non-governmental actors and specifically the civil society in the\ncreation and management of the Volunteerism Programme.

In fact, the National Volunteer Program will\nnot only facilitate access to latent human resources (unemployed,\nretirees, youth within all sectors  public, private, civil society,\nDiaspora), but also build the candidates soft capacities in terms of\ntheir active involvement into development issues.
