The\ngoal of this assistance is to help the Marzpetaran ensure sustainable\neconomic development in the marz by decreasing the economic security\nrisks through better planning for economic diversification. According to\nrough estimates, more than 85 percent of industrial output and 65 percent\nof total production and services in Syunik marz is contributed by mining\nindustry and further exploration of mineral deposits underway which could\nlead to the opening of new mines. This prospect has created a huge and\npotentially dangerous dependence on a single industry, and increases\nrisks for social problems and migration if the mining industry decreases\nits operations due to external market factors or the exhaustion of\nmineral resources in the future.  \nCurrently, Marzpetaran needs assistance to prepare a cost-benefit\nanalysis/ econometric model for better planning of investment in the\nregion for the diversification of the regional economy. The model will\nhelp to estimate the impact of investment (public or private) in the marz\non employment, income and other socio-economic factors. This would, in\nturn, make the planning process better equipped to maximize the impact of\ninvestment in non-mining sectors. The objective is to eventually decrease\ndependence on the mining industry by maximizing the outputs in non-mining\nsectors. The proposed approach of evidence-based planning is widely\napplied in many countries to justify and plan investment in\ninfrastructure, education and to inform and guide policy making.  \nUsing the terms of reference (TOR) prepared by an international\nconsultant commissioned by the OSCE, and under the guidance of the\nCo-ordinator of Econometric Modelling Project, the Econometric Modelling\nExperts will prepare the Syunik Regional Econometric Model (SREM) to be\nused by the regional administration of the Syunik marz and other\npartners. The Experts will design the model based on input - output\nrequirements to be prepared by the Project Co-ordinator using available\ndata. He/ she will provide training and support to the Ministry of\nTerritorial Administration and the Marzpetaran of the Syunik Region for\nthe application of the model and will help the regional administration of\nthe Syunik marz to plan improvements to the model based on new data and/\nor revised planning needs in the future. \nIn this regard the OSCE Office in Yerevan invites highly qualified,\nexperienced national professionals to perform services of the two\nEconometric Modelling Experts.

The\nOSCE Yerevan Office would like to engage the services of renowned\nEconometric Modelling Specialists who under the guidance of the Project\nCo-ordinator and in close co-operation with the database specialist will\nprepare a computer based input-output model that will address the\nrequirements of the TOR.\nThe SREM should be an interactive, searchable and user-friendly database\ncontaining the core data (historic and forecast). It should allow impact/\nscenario modelling which should allow a user to test the employment,\nincome, tax generation, and other factors impact of an intervention and\ncompare the results with the baseline data. As an illustrative guide to\neconomic research, as well as a useful quantitative aid to future\neconomic analysis, the model should be a workable tool that enables the\nuser to examine changes in the economic structure of the region, and\nobserve the impact on all other relevant economic variables. The project\noutcome/ report should consist of the fully functional Econometric Model\nbased on the requirements of the TOR (shall be delivered by 07 November\n2014).

The\ngoal of this assistance is to help the Marzpetaran ensure sustainable\neconomic development in the marz by decreasing the economic security\nrisks through better planning for economic diversification. According to\nrough estimates, more than 85 percent of industrial output and 65 percent\nof total production and services in Syunik marz is contributed by mining\nindustry and further exploration of mineral deposits underway which could\nlead to the opening of new mines. This prospect has created a huge and\npotentially dangerous dependence on a single industry, and increases\nrisks for social problems and migration if the mining industry decreases\nits operations due to external market factors or the exhaustion of\nmineral resources in the future.  \nCurrently, Marzpetaran needs assistance to prepare a cost-benefit\nanalysis/ econometric model for better planning of investment in the\nregion for the diversification of the regional economy. The model will\nhelp to estimate the impact of investment (public or private) in the marz\non employment, income and other socio-economic factors. This would, in\nturn, make the planning process better equipped to maximize the impact of\ninvestment in non-mining sectors. The objective is to eventually decrease\ndependence on the mining industry by maximizing the outputs in non-mining\nsectors.
