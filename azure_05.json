It is expected that participatory\nplanning will continue to be used as a mechanism for civic activation\nand inclusive decision-making. Given its importance as a source of\nlivelihood in Armenia, support to primary agricultural production\nremains important and is likely to continue as a central element of\nfuture programmes, as will small-scale community infrastructure. \nHowever, there are as noted, potential sources of gross margin and farm\nincome improvement which are largely not being exploited. These are\nprimarily available from agricultural cooperatives, food processing, and\ncold storage: areas where, in the medium and longer term, there is likely\nto be substantial growth. \nAn international consultant is being recruited to prepare a project\ndocument setting out proposals for support to enhanced rural development\nin selected areas of Armenia (to be identified by UNDP). Initial\ninvestigations suggest that, in addition to primary production and\ncommunity infrastructure, this support is likely to address:\n- Growth and development of cottage industry and micro-enterprise food\nprocessing, through a combination of business advisory services and\nbusiness infrastructure. It is also likely to involve establishment of\nfood microprocessing facilities as a basis for incubation. Measures to\nimprove access to finance for small-scale food processors are also\nanticipated, potentially through matching grants linked to bank loans;\n- Cold storage through very low energy, small-scale cold stores based on\nhigh insulation, natural ventilation, and evaporative cooling. This would\ninvolve adaptation and replication of traditional cooling methods used\nelsewhere, notably in the Central Asian countries; and\n- Facilitating the movement of labour out of agriculture to sectors with\nhigher productivity through rapid retraining and requalification, mainly\nfor participants from rural areas.\nIn meeting these objectives and compiling the draft project document,\nthe international consultant will therefore outline actions aimed at\nresponding to these needs, as well as any others considered important\n(and provisionally agreed with UNDP Armenia) during the course of\nproject preparation. Organizational and management arrangements for\ndelivery of the proposed actions will also be defined, setting out in\nthe process the role of national partner organizations and bodies, UNDP\nand other UN agencies, and other international development partners.\nProject costs and the duration of implementation will also be\nestimated.\nThe task of the National Consultant will be to support the international\nconsultant in this process. This support will be provided throughout the\npreparation of the project and will include actions in advance, during\nand after the international consultants visit to Armenia (which is\nstill to be scheduled). The support will comprise, but may not be\nrestricted to:\n- Identifying and collating key information, reports and publications\nrelated to the proposed project;\n- Assembling and analyzing data as specified by the international\nconsultant;\n- Identifying, contacting and making arrangements to meet key\nstakeholders; and\n- Drafting sections of the project document.\nThe national consultant will not normally be required to interpret into\nEnglish for the international consultant, but this may nonetheless be\nrequired on occasions when no interpreter is available.\nOutput:\nIn accordance with the objectives and tasks defined above, the output of\nthe assignment as a whole (to which the National Consultant will\ncontribute) will be a programme document for enhanced support to rural\ndevelopment in Armenia. This will, it is expected, be used as a basis\nfor actions by UNDP and, potentially, other UN agencies, as well as for\nraising funds for implementation and scaling-up.\nManagement Arrangements:\nUnder the overall guidance of the UN Resident Coordinator for Armenia,\nthe assignment will be conducted under the day-to-day supervision of the\nHead of the UNDP Socioeconomic Governance Portfolio.
