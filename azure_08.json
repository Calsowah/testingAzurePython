The primary goal of FLEX is improving\nmutual understanding between our countries and allowing young citizens of\nEurasia to have the opportunity to observe and experience our system of\ngovernment. Since the program??s inception in 1993, over 17,000 young\ncitizens from Eurasia have participated in FLEX and have returned to\ntheir countries imbued with a new enthusiasm and desire to help others\nand share their newly acquired experiences and knowledge for the\nbetterment of their home communities and countries.\nFinalists are chosen through a multi-layered, merit-based selection\nprocess that draws more than 40,000 candidates annually. Participation in\nthe selection process is open to all students that meet the eligibility\nrequirements, which include age limitations, satisfactory academic\nstanding, English language training, Armenian citizenship, and US visa\neligibility requirements. Selection is based on the evaluation of\nmultiple factors that contribute to a positive exchange experience and\nprovide evidence of leadership potential.
